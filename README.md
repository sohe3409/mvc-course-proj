# Game 21

## Description
This project is built with the framework Laravel and is the examination project for the course MVC. I have made a game called "Game 21" which is a dice game played with one or two dices and you play against the computer. The purpose is to gain coins or get a high score to make it into the High Score-list.


## Game rules

To play Game 21 you have to be a registered user. When you load the website you will see the startpage, which desplays two forms, login and register. If you are already a member you can login, otherwise you can make a user. After you are logged in you are redirected to the games startpage which you also can reach in the navbar.
